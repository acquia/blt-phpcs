Acquia BLT PHP_CodeSniffer
====

This is an [Acquia BLT](https://github.com/acquia/blt) plugin providing integration with [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) and [Acquia’s Coding Standards](https://github.com/acquia/coding-standards-php).

This plugin provides a set of commands in the `validate:phpcs` namespace that use PHP_CodeSniffer to check for coding standard violations.

When first installed, it will create a default phpcs.xml file utilizing Acquia’s Coding Standards if one does not exist.

This plugin is **community-supported**. Acquia does not provide any direct support for this software or provide any warranty as to its stability.
